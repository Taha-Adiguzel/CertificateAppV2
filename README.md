Certification Mobile App

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a mobile application that facilitates and regulates the certification process for individuals wishing to prove their competencies. Users can apply for certificates by submitting the required information and a video link as evidence of their skills. The application is built using Swift for iOS with SwiftUI or UIKit for the interface, and Firebase for database management.

Features

User Application: Users can search for certification areas, fill out forms with personal details, and submit proof of their competencies. Admin and Jury System: Admins review applications and invite qualified experts (jury) to evaluate the submissions. Certification Process: The jury reviews the evidence and decides whether to grant the certificate. If approved, the user receives the certificate. User Management: User and expert data are stored and managed using Firebase.
